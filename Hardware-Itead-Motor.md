## Introduction

## Flashing

![1CH - close shot](images/flashing/1ch-inching-flash.jpg)

Very much like the 1CH above (actually the photo above is from the 1CH). The main button is tied to GPIO0 so you can easily enter flash mode powering the board while pressing the button (the one thatâ€™s closer to the electrolytic capacitors). Pins 7, 8 and 9 of the PSA-B module are RX, TX and GND. You can use a 3-pin header or pogo pins to connect it.
