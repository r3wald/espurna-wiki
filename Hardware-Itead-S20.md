## Introduction

*TODO*

## Flashing

![S20 Smart Socket - Inside front view](images/flashing/s20-flash.jpg)

There is a labeled header in the front of the PCB and the button is connected to GPIO0, so no problems here.

Solder a 4 pin male or female header and connect it to your USB-to-UART bridge.  Then press and hold the button and connect the programmer to your computer. The micro-controller will boot into flash mode and you are ready to update the firmware.
