## Introduction

AG-L4 LED Desk Lamp

Note: the front white translucent dome is glued(!) onto the face. You will have to come up with some way to prize this off without damaging (too much). I haven't tried using some sort of heat gun or hair dryer, but this might work (or might not if it's something like cyanoacrylate glue). Also haven't tried it, but maybe a slight "squeeze" of the face could work also? Open at your own risk of damaging the fascia.
