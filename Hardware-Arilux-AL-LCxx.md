## Flashing

Open the plastic enclosure (using a sharp tool) and extract the little board inside.

You will see some soldering points with labels: GND, TX, RX and I00. If you are good enought with the soldering iron, connect dupont wires to these pads ([check this guide](Hardware-Magic-Home-LED-Controller)). 

If you prefer to got the safe way, use this tricky method: 

* bend the tip of some dupont wires, 
* glue the tip to a short piece of a ziptie
* hold the board in place with a couple of pins,
* hold the the zipties with clothespins
* adjust the tips of the dupont wires placing them carefully on the soldering pads

Finally, connect the dupont wires to your FTDI-USB dongle and follow the general instructions in [this page](Binaries) to start flashing.
