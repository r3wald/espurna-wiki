 i copied the template to the filestructure, i renamed all PLUGIN1 / plugin1 variables to my plugin name, is that necesarry ? a possible general ui in mind, for enabling or disabling plugins how different plugins has to look like that this would work ?

in arduino ide the path ./lib seems not be reachable 

i added in header files #if defined(XYZ)

to get updated templates could please put the plugin files in git ?

thanks in advance
