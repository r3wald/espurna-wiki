## Introduction

## Flashing
First, use a dremel to cut around the seam and expose the components.

Connect the leads. I used a piece of cardstock slipped under the board to help secure the leads. It is the same pin layout as KMC 70011.

I flashed just fine with a raspberry pi. Took a few hours to get the pins lined up.

I will post pictures soon
