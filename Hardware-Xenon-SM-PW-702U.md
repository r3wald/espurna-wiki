## Introduction

SM-PW702U is released under different brands.

## Flashing
First, use a dremel to cut around the seam and expose the components.

Connect the leads. I used a piece of cardstock slipped under the board to help secure the leads. It is the same pin layout as KMC 70011.

Put GPIO0 to ground, then connect VCC. Disconnect GPIO and you can flash.

I flashed just fine with a raspberry pi. Took a few hours to get the pins lined up.

I will post pictures once I figure out how.
